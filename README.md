# Clustering (Customer Segmentation) Project

## Introduction

This project aims to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior using unsupervised clustering techniques. 
The goal is to identify distinct customer groups with shared characteristics, enabling targeted marketing strategies and enhanced customer experiences.

## Dataset

Source: Mall_Customers.csv
Features:
CustomerID (unique identifier)
Gender (Male, Female)
Age (numerical)
Annual Income (numerical)
Spending Score (numerical, representing customer spending behavior)

## Project Structure

data: Contains the Mall_Customers.csv dataset.
notebooks:
EDA.ipynb: Exploratory Data Analysis (data cleaning, visualization, feature analysis)
clustering.ipynb: Implementation of K-Means clustering and cluster analysis
models: Saved clustering models (if applicable)
reports: Generated reports and visualizations

## Steps

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Data loading and cleaning
Descriptive statistics
Visualization of distributions, relationships, and correlations
Feature selection for clustering
K-Means Clustering:
Determine optimal number of clusters using techniques like the elbow method or silhouette analysis
Apply K-Means clustering to segment customers
Cluster Analysis:
Profile and visualize each cluster's characteristics
Interpret and label clusters based on their patterns
Evaluation and Interpretation:
Assess clustering quality and validity
Draw insights and recommendations for business applications

## Tools and Libraries
